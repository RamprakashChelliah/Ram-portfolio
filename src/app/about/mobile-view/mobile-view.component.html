                I have over 3.8+ years of experience working with .NET Core Web API. During this time, Iâ€™ve developed and maintained various modules such as payroll, attendance, leave management, timesheets, work items, performance tracking, feeds, and approval workflows.
                In addition to my backend expertise, I also have a strong interest in frontend technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular and React. <br><br>My goal is to grow into a proficient full-stack developer by continuing to expand my skills across both frontend and backend development.
